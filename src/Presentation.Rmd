## Abstract

- The project focus on creating Fraud Detection Application to detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- The increase in non-cash transactions leads to an increase in fraudulent transactions (Macaraeg, 2019). 
- Implemented fraud detection (using data mining) is important.  

## Motivation

- Using data mining to mitigate the risk of fraudulent, 
- Fraud detection is an interesting data mining project because it fights against criminal issues. 
- Application can be used by credit card companies to stop fraudulent transactions at real time.
- Design and test Machine Learning ALgorithm to find the interesting pattern to prevent fraud-transactions  
- Learn new methods (Predictive Model, Classification, Clusteringâ€¦) and apply them to solve the problem.

## Data Description

- Data is highly unbalanced (99.83% non-fraud vs. 0.17% fraud). This makes it hard to subset and train data (sampling). 
- The variables named v1 to v28 in order to maintain the privacy of the credit card users (Machine Learning Group, 2018).
- Data can be download at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud"> kaggle.com</a>

## Approach

- The learning goals
- Sampling data, selecting variables
- Data pre-processing for sequence information
- Selection of useful attributes
- Goals matched with DM methods
- Selection of data model(s), and method(s)
- Review and ask for feedback to improve
- Generate pattern (Data Mining)
- Interpret the model(s) based on visualization
- Integrate all discovered knowledge into reports, resolve any conflicts as needed
- Final Review & Improve base on given feedback

## Problem Statement 

- The data set is highly unbalanced (positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions). 
- Create a meaningful subset.
- Data Visualization, Confusion Matrix, Clustering Methods, and Decision Tree to detect meaningful patterns in fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Gabriel Preda (Machine Learning)

- <i>Accoring to Preda (2020)</i>, his work included investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features, and understanding the relationship between different features. He then investigated two predictive models. The data was split into 3 parts, a train set, a validation set, and a test set. For the first three models, He only used the train and test set.

## Pavan Sanagapati (Outliers)

- <b class="serif"><i>Anomaly detection</b></i> is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers (Sanagapati, 2019).Anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.
- Method used:
  <ol>
    <li><b class="design">Isolation Forest algorithm:</b> an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that identifies anomaly by isolating outliers in the data.</li>
    <li><b class="design">Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm:</b> unsupervised anomaly detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point concerning its neighbors.</li>
    <li><b class="design">Support Vector Machine (SVM) model:</b> a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.</li>

- <b>Sampling: </b> Sampling subset will include all the fraud transaction and 10,000 rows of normal transaction to test the accurate of SVM and Random Forest.Then subset the sampling data set in to <b>subset train data set(0.7) (Small_Train)</b> and <b>subset test data set(0.3) (Small_Test)</b>
```{r subset}
# Predictive Modeling
# Prepare Data for training
# Split data 70:30
Rdata$Class <- factor(Rdata$Class)

set.seed(1)
# Split data from vector data$Class into two sets in predefined ratio while preserving
# relative ratios of different labels in data$Class. Used to split the data used during
# classification into train and test subsets.
split <- sample.split(Rdata$Class, SplitRatio = 0.7)

train <- subset(Rdata, split == T) # train data set of the original data

cv <- subset(Rdata, split == F) # test data set of the original data

# CREATE SMALL SUBSET of the ORIGINAL
# Collect all normal transaction in the original data set
data.class.0 <- subset(Rdata, Rdata$Class == 0)

# Collect all fraud transaction in the original data set
data.class.1 <- subset(Rdata, Rdata$Class == 1)

# Get only 10,000 line of the normal transaction in the original data set
data.class.0 <- data.class.0[1:10000, ]

# Create the Subset Data
subsetData <- rbind(data.class.0, data.class.1)

rm(data.class.0,data.class.1) # Clean up/ un-use variable

## Data Visualization

- To get a general idea about the data 
- To draw hypothesis
- Algorithm
<ul>
  <li>Simply convert the Time in the data set to twenty-four hours time system. The purpose is to estimate what time fraud transaction amount usually occur</li>
  <li>geom_density() function of ggplot2 package</li>
  <li>ggplot() function of ggplot2 package</li>
</ul>
```{r visualPreparation}
#Copy the Rdata to DisplayData
DisplayData<- Rdata

DisplayData$hour_of_day <- (DisplayData$Time/3600) %% 24 # convert to hours, then reduce mod 24
# to display only
DisplayData$Class <- factor(ifelse(DisplayData$Class == 0, "zero", "one")) # creates issues later in caret if using 0, 1
```
</br>

## Transaction's Hour Density Chart

```{r transHoursPlot , fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
ggplot(DisplayData, aes(x = hour_of_day, fill = Class)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 24), breaks = seq(0, 24, 2)) + 
  labs(title = "Transaction's Hour", 
       x = "Hours", 
       y = "Density", 
       col = "Class") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Fraud", "Not Fraud"))
```
</br>
- Evaluation:
<ol>
  <li>Fraud transaction are happened from <b>0 to 8 AM</b> (early morning and during sleep time)</li>
  <li>Non-fraud transaction happen during nornal active-time (business hours)</li> 
  <li>This is also a common sense since human usually purchase in the day-time, not when they sleep</li>
  <li>Hypothesis: transactions happen at night (top at 3PM) have more chance to happen fraud-transactions.</li>
</ol>
</br>

## Transaction's Amount Density Chart

```{r transAmountPlot, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5}
ggplot(DisplayData, aes(x = Amount, fill = Class)) +

  labs(title = "Transaction Amount", 
       x = "Amount", 
       y = "Density", 
       col = "Class") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Fraud", "Not Fraud"))
```
</br>
- Evaluation:
<ol>
  <li>In the chart, the fraud transaction value from <b>90 to over 100</b> and <b>300 to 350</b> are way more density than the non-fraud transaction.</li> 
  <li>Hypothesis: Fraud transaction may happen to be large transaction (higher proportion of fraudulent transactions take a very large value).</li>
</ol>
