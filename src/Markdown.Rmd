## Abstract
</br>
<p>The project focus on creating <b class="serif"><i>Credit Cards Fraud Detection</b></i> to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  Thus, consumers and credit card companies are not paying 
for items that they did not purchase. According to Macaraeg (2019), 
the predicted worldwide non-cash transition <b>grows</b> from 2016 to 2020 is <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/credit-card-fraud-detection-a1c7e1b75f59">12.7%</a>. </br>
The increase in non-cash transactions leads to an increase in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/credit-card-fraud-detection-a1c7e1b75f59">fraudulent transactions</a> 
(Macaraeg, 2019). Even with <b>EMV smart chips</b> being implemented, the amount of money lost 
from credit card fraud is still very high. Therefore, implemented fraud detection 
(using data mining) is important.

## Problem Statement
<p>
<i>According to Machine Learning Group (2018)</i>, the datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of <b>284,807</b> transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for <b>0.172%</b> of all transactions.</p>

<p>Since the data set is <b>highly unbalanced</b>, it would be highly <b>skewed</b>. If we use this data frame as the base for our predicted model our algorithms will probably <b class="serif"><i>overfit</b></i> since it will "assume" that most transactions <b class="serif"><i>are not fraud</b></i>.

## Introduction{.tabset}

### <b class="design">Motivation</b>
</br>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>There are many application out there that focused on <b class="serif"><i>detect fraudulent credit card transactions</b></i> ,but most doesn't cover the whole issues. It is an interesting data mining project because it fights against <b>criminal issues</b>.</li>
  <li>To mitigate the risk of fraudulent, fraud detection using data mining is one of them. My application can be used by credit card companies to stop fraudulent transactions at the time that transition occurs.</li>
  <li>Measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the <b class="serif"><i>Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)</b></i>.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>There are no <b>"Null"</b> values, so we don't have to work on ways to replace values.</li>
    <li>Most of the transactions were <b>Non-Fraud (99.83%)</b> of the time, while <b>Fraud</b> transactions occurs <b>(017%)</b> of the time in the data frame.</li>
  </ul>
<hr class="line"></br>
</p>

#### Methods
</br>
<p><i>According to Patil, Nemade, & Soni. (2018)</i>,  the proposed system is used to detect the frauds on real time basis by analyzing incoming transactions. The system design consists of two components for fraud detection:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b class="design">Designing a framework for data pre-processing.</b> </li>
    <li>Designing analytical model for fraud prediction 
      <ol>
        <li><b class="design">Logistic regression.</b></li>
        <li><b class="design">Decision tree:</b> The  decision  tree  uses  <b>ID3  technique</b>  for  building  decision  tree  by  considering entropy of dataset</li>
        <li><b class="design">Random Forest Decision Tree:</b> are supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression problems. These two algorithms are best explained together because random forests are a bunch of decision trees combined.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>
#### Objectives
</br>
<p><i>According to Patil, Nemade, & Soni (2018):</i>
  <ul>
    <li>In the development of modern technology financial frauds are increasing significantly and hence fraud detection is very important area. Fraud detection is very important to save the financial losses for the banks as they issue credit cards  to  customer.</li> 
  <li>Without  knowledge  of  card  holder  use  of  the  card  information  is  a  credit  card  fraud.  There  are  two  types  of  fraud  detection  approaches:  <b class="serif"><i>misuse  detection</b></i>  and  <b class="serif"><i>anomaly  detection</b></i>.</li> 
  <li>More conversation can be retrieved from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325663203_Predictive_Modelling_For_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Using_Data_Analytics">(PDF) Predictive Modelling For Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Data Analytics</a>.</li>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>
#### Results
</br>
<p><i>According to Patil, Nemade, & Soni (2018):</i></p>
<p><b class="serif"><i>Logistic Regression Analytical Model</b></i>: The optimal  cut-off  <b>0.18</b>  is  used  by  the  Logistic Regression Analytical Model  model  ->  <b class="serif"><i>gives  better  performance</b></i>.</p>
  <p><b class="serif"><i>Decision Tree Analytical model</b></i>: To improve the performance of the decision tree, the most significant variable is taken from the trained model and the model is tuned  with those  most significant variables.</p>
  <p><b class="serif"><i>Random Forest Decision Tree Analytical model:</b></i> If data points are nonlinear then single line can be limiting to the logistic regression as the <b>outlier</b> points are not handle effectively, in that case the <b>decision tree</b> performs better.</p>
  <hr class="line"></br>
</p>
#### Limitation
</br>
<p>
 If data points are nonlinear then single line can be limiting to the logistic regression as the outlier points are not handle effectively.</br>
  <hr class="line"></br>
</p>
#### Main difference
</br>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Using a framework for data pre-processing.</li>
  <li>Method to train data for model prediction</li>
  <li>There is not much difference between what I plan (Logistic regression, decision tree,â€¦)</li>

  <li><b class="design">Light GBM algorithm:</b> Is a gradient boosting framework that uses a tree-based learning algorithm.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>

#### Objectives
</br>
<p><i>Retrieved from Preda (2020)</i>:
  <ul>
  <li>Design a <b class="serif"><i>Predictive Model</i></b> that can detect fraud transactions based on the train data.</li>
  <li>Make sure <b>true transaction</b> is not <i>rejected</i>.</li>
  <li>Make sure <b>fraudulent transaction</b> is not <i>accepted</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>

#### Results
</br>
<p>
  <p><i>Accoring to Preda (2020)</i>, his work included investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features, and understanding the relationship between different features. He then investigated two predictive models. The data was split into 3 parts, a train set, a validation set, and a test set. For the first three models, He only used the train and test set.</p>
  <p>The author started with <b class="serif"><i>RandomForrestClassifier</i></b>, for which he obtained an AUC score of <b>0.85</b> when predicting the target for the test set.</p>
  <p>He followed with an <b class="serif"><i>AdaBoostClassifier model</i></b>, with a lower AUC score <b>(0.83)</b> for prediction of the test set target values.</p>
  <p>Then followed with a <b class="serif"><i>CatBoostClassifier</i></b>, with the AUC score after training 500 iterations <b>0.86.</b></p>
  <p>The author then experimented with an <b class="serif"><i>XGBoost model</b></i>. In this case, He used the validation set for the validation of the training model. The best validation score obtained was <b>0.984</b>. Then He used the model with the best training step, to predict the target value from the test data; the AUC score obtained was <b>0.974</b>.</p>
  <p>He then presented the data to a <b class="serif"><i>LightGBM model</b></i>. The author used both train-validation split and cross-validation to evaluate the model effectiveness to predict 'Class' value, i.e. detecting if a transaction was fraudulent. With the first method, The author obtained the values of AUC for the validation set around <b>0.974</b>. For the test set, the score obtained was <b>0.946</b>.</p>
  <p>With the cross-validation, He obtained an AUC score for the test prediction of <b>0.93</b>.</p>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>

#### Main difference
</br>
<p>
  The author is using <b>AdaBoost model, XGBoost model, CatBoostClassifier</b> for gradient boosting on decision trees. I am going to use the <b>decision tree</b>, and <b>Generalized Linear Model(GLM)</b> Model for my model, but I am not going to use any of the </b>Gradient Boost Model</b>.</p>

### <b class="design">Pavan Sanagapati (Outliers)</b>{.tabset}
#### Methods
</br>
<p>According to Sanagapati (2019):</p>
<p>
  <p><b class="serif"><i>Anomaly detection</b></i> is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers (Sanagapati, 2019).Anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.</p>
  <p>Method used:</br>
  <ul>
    <li><b class="design">Isolation Forest algorithm:</b> an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that identifies anomaly by isolating outliers in the data.</li>
    <li><b class="design">Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm:</b> unsupervised anomaly detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point concerning its neighbors.</li>
    <li><b class="design">Support Vector Machine (SVM) model:</b> a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>
#### Objectives
</br>
<p>According to Sanagapati (2019):</p>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.</li>
  <li>Identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>
#### Results
</br>
<p>According to Sanagapati (2019):</p>
<p><b class="serif"><i>Isolation Forest</b></i> detected <b>73</b> errors versus Local Outlier Factor detecting <b>97</b> errors vs. SVM detecting </b>8516<b> errors.</b></p>
<p><b class="serif"><i>Isolation Forest</b></i> has a <b>99.74%</b> more accurate than <b class="serif"><i>LOF</b></i> of <b>99.65%</b> and <b class="serif"><i>SVM</b></i> of <b>70.09%</b></p>
<p>When comparing error precision & recall for 3 models, the Isolation Forest performed much better than the LOF as we can see that the detection of fraud cases is around <b>27 %</b> versus LOF detection rate of just <b>2 %</b> and SVM of <b>0%</b>.</p>
<p>So overall Isolation Forest Method <b>performed much better</b> in determining the fraud cases which is around <b>30%</b>.</p>
<p>We can also improve on this accuracy by increasing the sample size or use deep learning algorithms however at the cost of computational expense.We can also use complex anomaly detection models to get better accuracy in determining more fraudulent cases.</p>
  <hr class="line"></br>
<p>

#### Main difference
</br>
<p>The author using anomaly detection techniques, machine learning approaches, and Python for the analysis.</p>
<p>I am going to use the decision-tree model, and Generalized Linear Model(GLM) Model: logistic regression. I also using R Programming instead of Python.</p>

## Data Mining{.tabset}
### <b class="design">Data Visualization</b>{.tabset}
#### Methodology
<h5>Task Description</h5>
<p>Using data visualization to approach the problem. The purpose is to get a general idea about the data. Also supporting the following data mining Method in the following section.</br></p>
<h5>Algorithm and Parameter</h5>
<p>Simply convert the Time in the data set to twenty-four hours time system. The purpose is to estimate what time fraud transaction amount usually occur.</p></br>

```{r visualPreparation}
#Copy the Rdata to DisplayData
DisplayData<- Rdata

DisplayData$hour_of_day <- (DisplayData$Time/3600) %% 24 # convert to hours, then reduce mod 24
# to display only
DisplayData$Class <- factor(ifelse(DisplayData$Class == 0, "zero", "one")) # creates issues later in caret if using 0, 1
```
<p>Using geom_density() function of ggplot2 package to visualize the possibility of fraud transaction. From there we can summary some rules and evaluate the results. Details is given below. </p>
```{r ggplotParameter}
# GEOM_DENSITY
help_console('geom_density', "text", lines = 1:122, before = " ", after = " ")

#GGPLOT
help_console('ggplot', "text", lines = 1:26, before = " ", after = " ")
```
</br>


#### Results
<p>Visualization of Transaction's Hour</br>
  <h5>Evaluation</h5>
```{r transHoursPlot , echo=TRUE, fig.width=10}
ggplot(DisplayData, aes(x = hour_of_day, fill = Class)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 24), breaks = seq(0, 24, 2)) + 
  labs(title = "Transaction's Hour", 
       x = "Hours", 
       y = "Density", 
       col = "Class") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Fraud", "Not Fraud"))
```
<p> <p>According to the density-chart, fraud transaction are happened from <b>0 to 8 AM</b> (early morning and during sleep time) while non-fraud transaction happen during active-time. This is also a common sense since human usually purchase in the day-time, not when they sleep. Therefore, transactions happen at night (top at 3PM) have more chance to happen fraud-transactions.</p>
<hr class="line"></br></p>



<p>Visualization of Transaction's Amount</br>
<h5>Evaluation</h5>
```{r transAmountPlot, echo=TRUE, fig.width=10}
ggplot(DisplayData, aes(x = Amount, fill = Class)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 500), breaks = seq(0, 500, 100)) + 
  labs(title = "Transaction Amount", 
       x = "Amount", 
       y = "Density", 
       col = "Class") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Fraud", "Not Fraud"))

<p><p>According to the density-chart, higher portion of the chart are at fraud-transaction. In the chart the fraud transaction value from <b>90 to over 100</b> and <b>300 to 350</b> are way more density than the nonfraud transaction. Therefore, fraud transaction may happen to be large transaction (higher proportion of fraudulent transactions take a very large value). Since the data does not mention the value of amount (US Dollar or other currency), I leave the amount blank.</p>

## Conclusion
<p>Many algorithms and data-mining methods have been test and applied to the training dataset (fraud credit card). I took different approach to analyze interesting pattern in the data set.</p>
<p>I also take different approach for the training data (split the data, create factor value, get sample from the original data.). Un-success approach include:
- Clustering Models using k means.
- DBSCAN
- Dimension Reduction
- Elbow method
- Shilhouette method
Success approach include: 
- Random Forest Predictive Model (99.56 % average on fraud transactions)
- Regression Decision Tree Predictive Model (models 1 with 99.9999% on non-fraud transactions and model 2 with 99.59% test case on fraud transactions)
- Support-Vector Machines Models (89.18 % average on fraud transactions)
- Generalized Linear Model (99.988 % average on non-fraud transactions)
- Density-graph, that hypothesis can be made from there. 
In general, the research model will be able to recognize and detect fraud and non fraud transactions in the data set. In other to use it properly for an fraud detection application, choosing what models for what purpose is importance (Random Forest to detect fraud (99.59%); GLM and  Decision Tree model 1 (99.999 %) to verify non-fraud transaction).
